## Travel procedures

Conferences: Discuss with Gavin about travel and meetings in terms of plans for attending.
(preferably document these in mentoring plans)  
Generally, Gavin likes to get students to two meetings per year.
There are university funds available for up to $2,000 per fiscal year for students presenting their work at conferences. Additional funds for travel may be available via grant support - again, talk with Gavin. PI and university support for travel can be supplemented with external sources of travel funds (e.g. student travel fellowships from conference organizers/professional societies, etc.) and application to these is encouraged.

Necessary project travel will be covered under research grants as budgeted.  

Tip: Do not try to over-complicate travel. The more straightforward your travel logistics are, the easier this process is.

You should NOT have to pay out of pocket for things like registration, hotels, flights. Exceptions: if you are combining accomodation/flights with personal travel, it may be easier to pay from personal funds and be reimbursed by the university once you submit your expense report.  

In all cases, do things early enough so that you can get approval for charging university accounts.   

### Travel registration

_ALL_ overnight business travel (whether university sponsored or not) must be pre-authorized via a travel authorization.
This is necessary for you to be covered by university insurance.

_ALL_ out of state travel must be registered via Terra Dotta, link at: https://www.umassd.edu/peoplesoftfinance/ 


### Travel authorization procedure

1. Confirm with Gavin about travel, and submit detailed budget for approval.
2. If travel is out-of-state, complete Terra Dotta registration.
3. Assemble detailed travel budget and supporting documents.
3. Complete Travel Authorization (TA) Form and work with Chris Fox - Chris will enter the TA into the system once you have all the necessary information.
_NB. Non-university sponsored business travel (e.g. travel reimbursed directly by sponsor) requires you to complete a paper TA. Only charges made to university accounts (e.g. procard)
