Welcome! This folder contains resources for team members who transcribe audio/video files for the project. We track transcription progress via the [Airtable Transcript Tracker](https://airtable.com).  Here's some info about [what to put there](transcription/tracking).

In this folder you'll find:

* Useful scripts: for example, `upload.sh` is a Bash script that uploads your file to the right folder using rsync, assuming you have your username stored and asd aliased to asd.
* Suggested readings: these are papers about transcription itself that might be helpful to you (and are generally
interesting). Not required -- just here if you want them! Note that in-browser PDF rendering can scramble pages, so for the best reading experience, download and read locally.
* Data storage: there may come a day when you want to consult the raw source data for a project. There are two types of raw data:
  * [Paper Files] (datastorage/files)
  * [Recordings] (datastorage/recordings)
* All about transcribing: includes lots of good-to-know info such as...

  * [Transcription Overview](transcription)
  * [Formatting and Uploading](transcription/formatting-uploading)
  * [ELAN Tips and Tricks](transcription/elan)
  * [Activity Details] (transcription/activities)
  * [ADOS overview](transcription/ados)
  * [Transcription Guidelines] (transcription/guidelines)
  * [UW Specific Information] (transcription/uw)

# Servers

The main server for transcription related purposes is asd, formally `asd.cslu.ohsu.edu`.

Some other servers you may hear about are bergamot (`login.cslu.ohsu.edu`), which is used to tunnel into internal servers from outside the network, and the Big Birds (`bigbirdN.cslu.ohsu.edu`), which are the center's computing cluster.  If someone wants you to work on one of these, they'll probably give you more information about it at the time.
